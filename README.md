# Pixel&Code Susy Grid

This Susy 3 based grid is used internally by development agency Pixel&Code. Use at your own risk.

### Dependencies

* Normalize SCSS
* Susy 3
* Susy svg-grid plugin

Make sure you import the dependencies that are installed by this package (import them in your own SCSS files). Without these the grid won't work.

**Example:**

```scss
@import '**Your path**/normalize-scss/_normalize.scss';
@import '**Your path**/susy/sass/susy';
@import '**Your path**/susy/sass/plugins/svg-grid';
```
